# koa-js

Koa js is the modern and minimalist NodeJS Framework. It comes with ES6 features like async await, arrow functions, destructuring etc...

It provides a minimal interface for developing apps and APIs.

Koa is extremely light weight, it has thinner and better middleware.

You can extend the framework by adding the modules.

Koa comes with context (ctx) objects instead of request and response objects. It helps us write APIs more efficiently with help of methods.

It comes with modules like Koa Router, Koa EJS Templating and Koa Body Parser.

Advantages of KOA
-- Very small footprint but easily extended
-- Fast and efficient
-- Modernized syntax
-- Enhanced HTTP request and response
-- Simple to learn if you know express
